# cfg-femtech-project

This team project was carried out as a final assessment for my nanodegree with Code First Girls.

I used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels to investigate the following questions:

1. How has the usage of natural family planning in the UK grown over time compared to other contraceptive methods? Is there a negative correlation between the number of emergency contraceptives prescribed and the growth of natural family planning? Has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced how people access sexual health advice?

2. Who is most likely to use natural family planning? Are certain contraceptive methods more prevalent amongst certain demographic groups?

3. How has investment in Femtech grown, and how is it predicted to grow over the next 5 years?

Full analysis, results, and report are included in the main branch.
